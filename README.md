COP3530 Movie Quiz

Hello, we made a title recommender that uses data from IMDB and has the user answer quiz questions in order to recommend a title.

The data file is title.basics.tsv.gz from https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/
  It was too large of a file to upload to GitHub
  Our program doesn't read the whole file but a variable can be set to change how many rows are loaded (UP TO 7 MILLION WOW!)
  
We used an AVL Tree and Map to store the data

Enjoy!
